# tree-sitter-manuscript-functions

[Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) grammar for Sibelius ManuScript functions. This grammar can be used to parse

- `.mss` files generated by [Tido's plgToMSS](https://github.com/tido/plgToMSS/)
- `.plg` files and plgToMSS style `.msd` files (only in conjunction with [tree-sitter-manuscript-plg](https://github.com/notengrafik/tree-sitter-manuscript-plg))

ManuScript is the plugin language of Avid's [Sibelius](http://www.sibelius.com/) music notation software. It is based on [Simkin](http://www.simkin.co.uk/simkin_language.html).
